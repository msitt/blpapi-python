Version 3.17.1:
===============
- Stability and performance improvements

Version 3.17.0:
===============
- Native-type formatting and message consumption
	Add ability to format 'Event's and 'Request's from native Python types
	using methods 'EventFormatter.fromPy' and 'Request.fromPy'. Add ability
	to convert a 'Message' to 'dict' with 'Message.toPy'. 'Message's and
	'Request's have 'dict'-like behavior with '__getitem__' and
	'__setitem__'.
	
- A new method 'correlationId()' is added to 'blpapi.Message'
	A new method 'Message.correlationId()' is added to return the
	single CorrelationId associated with the message or None if the
	message has no CorrelationIds. If the message has multiple
	CorrelationIds, the first one is returned.
	
- Constants for common used `Names`
	A new utility class `blpapi.Names` has been added with common
	message names.

- Revamped examples
	The 'examples' directory now contains 'demoapps' and 'unittests'
	subdirectories. The 'demoapps' directory contains a consolidated set of
	example applications. Within 'demoapps', the 'snippets' directory contains
	sample code for creating and sending requests, and for processing
	responses. Also within 'demoapps', the 'util' directory contains common
	code shared between examples. The 'unittests' directory has been renamed
	from 'mock-test-examples' and contains sample code for using the mock
	testing interface.

- End of Python 2 support
	Installation and use of BLPAPI Python now requires a Python 3.6+
	runtime.

Version 3.16.1:
===============
- Stability and performance improvements

Version 3.16.0:
===============
- Attributes are no longer supported in 'blpapi.ResolutionList'
	Support for attributes during resolution was never fully implemented
	and is now deprecated.

- Provide users ability to unit test applications offline using testing frameworks
	The new utility module 'blpapi.test' can be used to create test events
	and test messages. The test messages can be generated using Python
	dictionaries, XML, JSON, or they can be built in a similar way to how
	messages are normally constructed in the SDK.

- Added unique request id to network interactions
	A new, globally unique, request id has been added to network
	interactions.  The request id is a string that can be obtained by
	calling 'Request.getRequestId()' before sending a request, and
	'Message.getRequestId()' for messages delivered to the application.

	Not all requests and messages will have a request id, notably
	subscription data messages will *not* have a request id except
	for recaps.

	This unique identifier will be useful when contacting support as it
	will help quickly locate the interactions related to that event.

Version 3.15.2:
===============
- Stability and performance improvements

Version 3.15.1:
===============
- 'blpapi.Service.createAdminEvent()' is now deprecated. Use 'blpapi.Service.createPublishEvent()' instead

- Stability and performance improvements

Version 3.15.0:
===============
- Provided a simplified interface to handle authentication and authorization
	- Simplified authentication settings through the new set of strongly-typed
	  overloads described with 'AuthOptions' class.

	- Simplified existing multi-phased approach to authorization so that both
	  token generation and authorization can be done by the SDK.
		- If 'AuthOptions' instance is provided to the session through the
		  newly introduced 'setSessionIdentityOptions' (part of'SessionOptions'),
		  both token generation and subsequent authorization will be done by the
		  SDK. Successfully authorized identity would become the default
		  identity for the session that's used for all future requests unless
		  a different one is specified explicitly.

		- Additionally, two new session methods that simplify creation of
		  additional identities have been introduced:
			- 'generateAuthorizedIdentity' - generates authorized identity
			  based on the provided 'AuthOptions'.
		- 'getAuthorizedIdentity' - returns authorized identity that's
		  associated with the 'generateAuthorizedIdentity' call.

- Improved usage of network bandwidth through support for compression

- 'blpapi.Message.topicName()' is now deprecated

- Stability and performance improvements

Version 3.14.1:
===============
- Stability and performance improvements

Version 3.14.0:
===============
- Improved usage of network bandwidth for snapshot requests
    Optimized the network bandwidth usage between endpoints and Bloomberg data
    centers for snapshot requests. Customers can request to disable the
    optimization by setting the 'bandwidthSaveModeDisabled' session option.

- Stability and performance improvements

Version 3.13.1:
===============
- Conversions to string using print helpers ignore null-terminators
	Previously, when converting an e.g., Element to string explicitly,
	or when printing it, null-terminators embedded in strings
	would cause the resulting string to be truncated to the first one.

- Format docstrings to be rendered by the Sphinx documentation generator
- Stability and performance improvements

Version 3.13.0:
===============
- Automated network configuration for ZFP over leased lines
    Allow customers that leverage leased lines/routers for Bloomberg services
    (such as existing Bloomberg terminals) to use this infrastructure to
    connect their applications to Zero Foot-Print (ZFP) instances.

    A new utility class, 'blpapi.ZfpUtil', can be used to create a
    'SessionOptions' object with the appropriate servers. Applications can
    update the options, including authorization settings, but should not
    change the servers.

    Added a new example ZfpOverLeasedLinesSessionExample.py to demonstrate
    how to create a session over ZFP leased lines.

- Stability and performance improvements

- Add support for zero footprint connections
- Add support for fragmented recaps
- Add support for consuming microseconds

Version 3.10.0:
===============
