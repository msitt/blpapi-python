"""Provide a session that can be used for providing services.

ProviderSession inherits from AbstractSession. In addition to AbstractSession
functionality, ProviderSession provides functions that are needed to support
publishing like 'registerService', 'createTopics' and 'publish'.

Topic Life Cycle
----------------
A provider wishing to publish subscription data must explicitly open each topic
on which they publish using 'ProviderSession.createTopics' (or
'ProviderSession.createTopicsAsync'). Creating a topic prepares the
distribution and caching infrastructure for new data associated with the
topic's resolved identifier. (Note that several different topics could resolve
to the same ID.) Independent of a topic's creation status is its subscription
status, i.e. whether there are subscribers ready to receive the data published.
A topic that is both created and subscribed is *activated*.

There are two models for managing topic creation: broadcast and interactive.
Broadcast publishers proactively call 'ProviderSession.createTopic*' for each
topic on which they intend to publish, while interactive publishers wait to
receive a 'TopicSubscribed' message (within an 'Event' of type
'Event.TOPIC_STATUS') before calling 'ProviderSession.createTopic*' in
response. Topics are resolved before they are created---it is possible that
multiple different topic strings will map to the same underlying topic. See
below for the behavior of the SDK when the same topic is created multiple
times.

After 'ProviderSession.createTopic*' is called, the publisher will receive a
'TopicCreated' message (within an 'Event.TOPIC_STATUS' event), and when there
is at least one subscriber to the topic the publisher will then receive a
'TopicActivated' message (also within an 'Event.TOPIC_STATUS' event). As
subscribers come and go, additional 'TopicSubscribed', 'TopicActivated',
'TopicUnsubscribed', and 'TopicDeactivated' messages may be received by the
publisher. A 'Topic' object can be retrieved from each of these messages using
the 'ProviderSession.getTopic' method, and this object can be used for
subsequent calls to 'EventFormatter.appendMessage' and
'ProviderSession.deleteTopic'. In the case that the same resolved topic is
created multiple times by a publisher using different names, it is unspecified
which of those names will be returned by 'Message.topicName' for these (or
other) messages.

If a publisher no longer intends to publish data on a topic, it can call
'ProviderSession.deleteTopic*' to free the internal caching and distribution
resources associated with the topic. When a resolved topic has been deleted the
same number of times that it has been created, a 'TopicDeleted' message will be
delivered, preceded by 'TopicUnsubscribed' and 'TopicDeactivated' messages if
the topic was still subscribed (and activated). No further messages can be
published on a deleted topic.

Deregistering a service deletes all topics associated with that service.

Note that 'TopicActivated' and 'TopicDeactivated' messages are entirely
redundant with 'TopicCreated', 'TopicSubscribed', 'TopicDeleted', and
'TopicUnsubscribed' messages, and are provided only for the convenience of
publishers that do not maintain per-topic state.
